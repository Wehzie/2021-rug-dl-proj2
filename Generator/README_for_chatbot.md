To run the model simply run the file model.py using python3.

If you want to use GloVe embeddings you first have to download them from here:

Get file glove.6B.100d.txt.

Add the .txt file to the Generator/glove folder and then select the option when
prompted by model.py.

In case you want to actually chat with the model uncomment line 177 from model.py.
Press 'q' or type 'quit' to quit the chat.
