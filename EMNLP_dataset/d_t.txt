The kitchen stinks . __eou__ I'll throw out the garbage . __eou__
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? __eou__ Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__ Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__ Not for me , Dick . __eou__
Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? __eou__ Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . __eou__
Would you mind waiting a while ? __eou__ Well , how long will it be ? __eou__ I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . __eou__ OK . We'll wait . __eou__
Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one . __eou__ Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for . __eou__ The pleasure is mine . __eou__
Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ I am wiped out . Thank you . __eou__ Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Never ! But thank you for inviting me . __eou__ Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . __eou__
